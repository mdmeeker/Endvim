# Endgame.nvim

My pretty much endgame neovim setup, heavily inspired by [shaunsingh/nyoom.nvim](github.com/shaunsingh/nyoom.nvim); similarly, written in Rust and Fennel
rather than the usual Lua... Feature everything I imagined I could possibly need. Most of my work is in various systems languages (naturally, mostly C and C++),
Python, Julia, and whatever side things I decide to pick up.

With this all in mind, it's likely that you end up not needing to configure beyond installation, but I recommend that you do so nonetheless.


## Requirements
In particular, ensure that you have neovim nightly.
